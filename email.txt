Subject: AI Pod: New Era in Patient Histories

Hi Dr. Contact {last_name}!

I’m Nathan, 17, building an AI pod to see if AI can revolutionize history intake.

We’ve engaged AMIE authors on AI's role in patient questioning. Our goal is to equip LLMs with tools for clinician-level histories.

I noticed your work on {specific project/interest}. Harvard and JHU back us with GPU access.

I’d love your insight on exam devices and spinning our research into a paper. Please book here: [calendly link].

Thanks,  
Nathan Yan
